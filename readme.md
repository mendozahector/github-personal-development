Version Control (of one file) â€“ can create conflict specially if multiple people are working on the same features and code.

Layers are usually dependent on the number of teams.
Each developer takes a new branch from the corresponding version branch (that comes from the group layer).

If change commits create conflict with the version branch, you must first update merge and resolve any inflicts inside of your branch, in order to have up to date code and re-test before checking back in (N+1).

If the layer also has the same type of conflict, we must also do the same (update, merge) to make sure you have the latest updates.

Depending on your team organization, you want to go as deep in branches in order to keep a well organization of code.

Most merges take 5-10 minutes. We can check for new versions early in the morning.

**Key points:**

If you want to change something, first update, then merge, then commit.

_Major rules of databases:_

ACID: Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable.

CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete

1st - Change and commit

2nd - Update, merge, commit

3rd - Merge, commit
