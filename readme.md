## Part 2: Minutes on GitHub Training

Version Control (of one file) â€“ can create conflict specially if multiple people are working on the same features and code.

Layers are usually dependent on the number of teams.
Each developer takes a new branch from the corresponding version branch (that comes from the group layer).

If change commits create conflict with the version branch, you must first update merge and resolve any inflicts inside of your branch, in order to have up to date code and re-test before checking back in (N+1).

If the layer also has the same type of conflict, we must also do the same (update, merge) to make sure you have the latest updates.

Depending on your team organization, you want to go as deep in branches in order to keep a well organization of code.

Most merges take 5-10 minutes. We can check for new versions early in the morning.

**Key points:**

If you want to change something, first update, then merge, then commit.

_Major rules of databases:_

ACID: Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable.

CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete

1st - Change and commit

2nd - Update, merge, commit

3rd - Merge, commit

## Part 3: Sprint/Completed Story

As a team, we were able to get together and spend some time navigating through GitHub, getting our developer environment running, and adding our individual branch to the project.

**As a** contributing member of Team One

**I need to** re-setup my developer environment and look over the project goals and requirements (new updates were received this week)

**So that** I will be ready to dive into the project, and know what the customer is asking, and start developing ideas and implementing them. Also, completing the SRS document as a Team.

_Summary: Developer Environment is up and running. GitHub profile added as a contributor to the team, and new personal development branch added (see link above). We also went through the User Stories PowerPoint and New Scope Document to better familiarize with our new team tasking._
